# Spotify_clone
Project Overview: The Spotify clone project aims to replicate some of the core features and aesthetics of the popular music streaming platform, Spotify. While it won't have the full functionality of Spotify, it will serve as a simplified version demonstrating key components like-music playback, playlists, and a user-friendly interface.
